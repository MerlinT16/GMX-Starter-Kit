        A lot to like here. There is strong acting and a pop-video, heroin-chic sheen to the show's visuals that are as pretty as they are appealingly deviant... But [it] also feels somewhat suffocating as a series, by refusing to be anything but nihilistic.

        Zendaya is reinvented as the self-destructive, self-loathing Rue, in what is a truly astonishing, mesmerising performance, upending every expectation of what she could do.

        The Euphoria season 1 finale was full of the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.

        Euphoria unflinchingly uncovers the terrors thrust upon today’s teens with raw realism, requiring its audience’s rapt attention (just as Zendaya's livewire lead performance does).

   <u> FUN FACTS ABOUT EUPHORIA:</u>
</kai>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<Steffi>
    1) Euphoria is actually an adaptation of an Israeli series.
Yep, Euphoria is not an entirely original series. It's adapted from a series of the same name, created by Ron Lesham. The 2012 Israeli series only aired 10 episodes and was set in the '90s. A lot of the characters on the HBO show share some similarities with the original characters too, including Rue, Kat and Ashtray.
<br>
<br>
2) The series draws on Sam Levinson’s real life experiences.
While it borrows some aspects of the original Israeli series, a lot of HBO's Euphoria is rooted in Sam Levinson's own experiences with substance abuse, addiction and rehab.
In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Levinson explained: "I just wrote myself as a teenager. I think those feelings and memories they’re still extremely accessible to me. So it’s not a hard reach. I just write myself and what I was feeling and what I was going through when I was younger and I was dealing with addiction."
<br>
<br>
3) Zendaya was the ONLY choice to play Rue.
Euphoria without Zendaya? Absolutely not. Speaking to EW, Zendaya revealed: "Sam told me that I was on his vision board for Rue, which I thought was crazy. I was like, 'I don't believe you. What in my career have I done to prove that I can do this?'"
<br>
<br>
4) In a reported early draft of the scrapped pilot script, a huge main character is killed off.
In an apparent early draft script from 2017 that's been widely shared online, one shock storyline features the death of a major character, seemingly at the hands of another major character. It also echos a storyline in the original Israeli series.
This storyline still might end up being adapted and mixed into the series so, to avoid potential spoilers, we won't reveal which characters were involved... If you don't already know, and want to find out, you can read an excerpt of the script here.
<br>
<br>
5) Fez was supposed to die at the end of season 1 and season 2.
Angus Cloud has managed to avoid being killed off the series twice, as it's been revealed that Fezco almost met his end in both season finales.
While he doesn't know how Fez was going to die in the season 1 finale, Angus told GQ that Jacob Elordi spilled his shock death while filming the pilot episode. For season 2, the script was rewritten the day before the police raid scene was filmed. In the original finale script, Fez was the one who died but it was later changed to Ashtray
